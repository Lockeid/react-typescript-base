## What is it ?

A base for my React + Typescript + Webpack 2 config.  
It includes Ava for tests, and ESLint with some rules from the Airbnb package.

## Commands

`npm test` run tests using ava. By default it matchs all the js files in `tests` folder.

`npm start` run the webpack dev server on the port 3000 with hot reload.

`npm run dist` package everything in the dist folder.
